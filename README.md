# Cartoonify Images

**Cartoonify Images** is a computer vision project that converts photographs into cartoon-like images by preserving key edges, simplifying textures, and enhancing colors. The repository includes data, scripts, and notebooks to demonstrate classical image-processing methods and deep learning approaches.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Cartoonification is a fun and creative application of computer vision. It takes real-world images and transforms them into stylized cartoon outputs. This project explores:

* Classical image processing (edge detection, bilateral filtering, color quantization)
* Deep learning-based image-to-image translation
* End-to-end pipeline: load image → preprocess → cartoonify → save/display result

---

## 🔍 Key Features

* Convert images to cartoon-style using OpenCV filters
* Edge-preserving smoothing and sharpening
* Color simplification (quantization / clustering)
* Option to run deep learning models for better results
* Jupyter notebooks for experimentation
* Simple CLI and demo script for cartoonifying images in bulk

## 🛠️ Installation

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies (`requirements.txt`):

```
numpy
opencv-python
matplotlib
scikit-image
jupyterlab
tensorflow / pytorch (if deep learning is used)
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Cartoonify a single image with the demo script:

```bash
python demo.py --input data/input/sample.jpg --output data/output/cartoon.jpg
```

Or run a notebook (`notebooks/01_classical_methods.ipynb`) to explore step by step.

## 🧩 Methods

### Classical (OpenCV-based):

1. Resize and normalize input image
2. Convert to grayscale and apply median blur
3. Detect edges (adaptive thresholding, Canny)
4. Apply bilateral filter to smooth colors while preserving edges
5. Combine edges and smoothed image for final cartoon effect

### Deep Learning:

* Use pretrained GAN or autoencoder models for image-to-cartoon translation
* Training scripts can be added if dataset is available

Example transformations are saved in `reports/figures/` with before/after comparisons. Add sample outputs to README for better visualization.
